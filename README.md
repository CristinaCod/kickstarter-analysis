# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
#### Purpose
        The purpose of this project was to provide up and coming playwright Louise with starting her crowdfunding campaign to pay for her first play, FEVER. Keeping in mind her budget of $10,000+ I assisted her in determining if there are specific factors or elements that make a campaign successful by organizing, sorting, and analyzing pre-existing crowdfunding data. These insights will allow Louise to understand her campaign from start to finish by mirroring other successful campaigns.In doing so, I personally got to develop and hone in my Excel skills through use of different functions, graphs, tables, etc. to perfect my analysis.
## Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis of Findings
There are multiple factors to influence the success of crowdfunding campaigns but in this case, we will be looking specifically at theater outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on goals for Louise. Through my analysis it was determined that there is a specific time of the year that yields the highest success rates of plays as well as a specific goal range where we also see the highest rate of success for plays. These findings are visually displayed in the attached images of the line graphs developed for each theory.

#### Challenges
Personal challenges I experienced during the analysis included comprehension issues of specific formulas such as “COUNTIFS”. I had two thirds of the necessary function completed but was struggling with how to articulate the “goals” part based on the provided parameters. This challenge was overcome by asking for assistance from classmates and utilizing their advice. One classmate took time to provide gentle guidance in how to complete my formula so that I could figure it out and make it work properly and I could complete the deliverable. Other issues experienced involve the Outcomes Based on Goals line graph displaying too much excess information from the entirety of the data field and not specifically just the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled plays. After playing around with Excel for a bit I eventually found out how to make the graph reflect the necessary information. I have noticed that figuring out how to edit graphs on a Mac differs a lot from on a PC, so there is a learning curve there when watching demonstrations in class versus doing it on my own.
## Results
#### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Based on the data we can vividly see the plays that were most successful were released in May-June. There is steady growth in successfulness of plays, up until this point, from the start of the year except for a brief drop off in March. Even plays that were considered failures still experienced their highest numbers in May. After those early spring months there is a downward trend in successfulness of plays which could likely be attributed to the warmth of summer months and people participating in more outdoor activities opposed to indoors ones such as attending plays. This theory of weather effecting play success also proves relevant seeming as how successful and failed plays in December are only two data points away from being equal. There is also a steady decrease in play success once we get to the colder winter months possibly because now it is too cold, and people would prefer to stay home over going out places. Therefore, springtime, specifically May, is the most ideal time for Louise to launch her play as this is when she will see the most success. 
#### Outcomes Based on Goals
When determining outcomes based on goals, most interestingly, the percentage successful vs percentage failed are directly inverted based on goals. We saw the highest percent of successful plays when the goal was between $1,000-$4,999. Excluding an inexplicable spike in success rates for the $35,00-$39,000 and $40,000-$44,999 goal ranges, there is a negative trend in percent successful rates as the goal values increase. Conversely, we can also see that as goal values go up the percentage of failed plays also increases perhaps because others over-estimated how well they would do. This is good news for Louise as she was looking to stay in the $10,000 range. Meaning she may even have leftover funds to utilize for something else or different aspects of her play production.  
#### Summary
In summary, for Louise to have the most successful play she should aim for a launch date in May as well as sticking in the $1,000-$4,999 goal range. Based on previous funding campaigns data suggests that when looking at these two variables this is when they saw the most success. For Louise to have a successful launch of her first play she should mimic previous successes. As we are only examining these two factors for Louise there are limitations to the findings and room for improvement or further research. 
#### Limitations
There are limitations in determining the success of plays. A play is deemed success if their pledged amount is greater than the goal amount. However, if we look at plays like ‘Foresight’ we see they only made $4 more than their goal amount. Same goes for ‘"The Tale of The Cockatrice" by Peafrog Puppetry’ grossing only an extra $3.22. This begs the question of how successful these plays are if they are just barely breaking even. Perhaps success could be improved if it was determined by plays that pledged at least half of their goal. This would obviously make successfulness harder to attain however it would be a good goal to strive for. The main limitation here for Louise is that we are only examining two factors for her, outcomes based on launch dates and goals. This alludes to recommendations for different variables we could test for.
#### Recommendations 
For example, perhaps we could look at genres of plays such as romance, action, mystery, musicals, etc. to see which was the most successful and display those findings in a bar graph for Louise to ponder over. This may not help her with her first play as it is already written but perhaps in the future, she may try to write a new play that aligns with a more popular genre. I also think it would be interesting for Louise to examine success based on country such as the UK versus the US. I feel as though plays are more popular in the UK as it is the birthplace of many famous poets and writers whose works have been adapted into play format.
